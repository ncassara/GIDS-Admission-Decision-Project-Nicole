# GIDS-Admission-Decision-project

# Project Description

Building a python program that takes a folder consisting of Excel files and outputs on spredsheet with mainly the "Recommended Action" and other columns as deemed necessary by the program cordinator. The program cordinator assign applicants to reviewers for them to be rated based on certain rubrics required for admission. Each reviewer is given an Excel file filled with applicant details and reviewers are required to send the Excel files after they are done rating applicants. The program cordinator then collates all the ratings from each reviewer and manually review the decisions made by each reviewer before making a final admission decision for applicants. Discussions with the progarms cordinator shows that, most times the process can be very tedious. The aim of this project is to assist the program cordinator and reduce the workload of  having to manually review multiple Excel files to make admission decisions.

  - Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file to your desired location on your computer. 
  
+ Open you Anaconda Command Prompt.

+ Type in the directory that contains the extracted files. For example, if the extracted files are located in the `Student Worker` folder, you can navigate to that folder using the command. You can simply drag the folder to the shell (cd [directory name])
```
cd DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_EXTRACTED_FILES
```
+ Once you are in the correct directory, you can run your file using the appropriate command for the programming language. For example: For Python files, you can run the file using the command:
